## Description
Repo for the first challenge of the Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. In this project, I changed the CSS code so that it is more well optimized and follows better semantic structure. In the HTML file, I changed several divs to their proper element tag, and added an ID to one div so that the link to it in the nav would function properly. I included comments wherever I made changes in the CSS file to highlight them. Most of these changes involved combining selectors where their declarations were the exact same, or changing the selector from a class to an element selector where divs with classes were changed to elements in the HTML.
